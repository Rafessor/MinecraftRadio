You can simply add new Radio Stations and languages to this plugin.

How to add a language:
If you want to add a language simply copy the langEnglish.txt file and rename it to for example langRussian.txt 
and than retranslate everything in the file. You will also have to put the name of the language at the place with
 the key "lang", so in this example you would have to put "lang: Russian" there.
 
 How to add a Radio station:
 Simply create a folder in the "Radios" folder with the name the Station should have. Than add .nbs files and the 
 plugin will do the rest for you. If you dont have .nbs files there are 2 ways of getting them. You will find many 
 downloadable .nbs songs in the internet and you can also convert .midi songs to .nbs songs by yourself using 
 NoteBlockStudio (google will help you)
